A project for the Python course @ FMI

PyDay is a web app, with authorization, authentification modules, which purpose is to help each user schedule his tasks easily.
It is a calendar with events and special notifications, which he can tag his friends in. Two users become friends if and only if the follow each other. 
Each user is able to connect his rapsberry with the system and the raspberry will then become an alarm clock (with 2 display matrices 8x8). In order to stop the alarm, the user must use a voice command 'Stop'.
